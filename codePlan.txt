ok so just made this text file to think through exactly what I need to do and how I'm going to do it.
We have tasks that need to be completed. That means we are going to need to check every once and a while whether somethings happening.
There needs to be a system that looks what you have for this day and this week and further and helps you get on your feet if youre doing nothing on your computer.
That means we need a clock system, a notification system, a logic system, and a save system. Maybe I should actually make a task class dang it.

Clock is easy. setInterval is here to save the day. (Note: setInterval(func,milliseconds))

Save system shouldn't be too hard. I'd like to do a little bit of compression or something idk. But load up on enter and autosave every once and a while.

Notification system. Just a tool for the logic system. Electron has some good stuff on that.

Logic system is the hard part.
    - It grabs the tasks and projects from the save file.
    - It should try and motivate the user to work for a certain amount of time before taking a break. 
     + to track this the user should check in when starting a task.
     + logic unit will track if the user has completed the task and notify them if thats true.
      ~ once the task is completed the logic unit will wait a little before suggesting another task.
    - The logic system should figure out how much time is left in the day/week and calculate how dire a task needs to be done.
     + It should also calculate how productive the user has been over the course of the day.
     + based on these two calculation it should decide when to encourage user to do different tasks.
